Files in this directory:

- README: this file.

- folder "old": contains old scripts / analysis that are no more used, but the code might come in handy for future projects.

- folder "output": contains the images used in the report. These are updated daily. Strictly speaking, this folder is not necessary but is interesting to have a look at the results every once in a while

- folder "job-scripts": contains all the scripts to perform activities that are run periodically. These scripts are called by the "0-launch" scripts. Inside this folder there is another "README" file with additional info on all the activities performed.

- folder "other-scripts": contains scripts that are not regularly launched but might be useful in the future. (e.g scripts for seasonal tournament)

- folder "templates": contains markdown templates and images used in the report. There's also a "output" folder that should not be here but can't be removed or it breaks the markdown.

- "0-launch.R" and similar .R scripts: these files are run periodically and wrap all the scripts that need to be launched. They also return errors if anything wrong happens during the analysis.

- "0-launch.log" and similar .log files: these contain the logs of the .R scripts. Useful to check whenever an error happen

99% of the job is automated. The only manual intervention required is the following:

- Once a week, choose the full-art and emote to be used in the weekly report. Save them on "lor-meta.com" and update the "publish-report.R" script with the name of those files.

- After "publish-report.R" job finishes, it is necessary to perform "bundle exec jekyll build" to publish the website.

- Once the report is published, make a tweet and a reddit post about it (this could be automated, I'll look into it).

- If a push notification notifies of an error, manual intervention is usually required to fix those and relaunch whatever it was that stopped because of the error.
