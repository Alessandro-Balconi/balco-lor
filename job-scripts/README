# 8-HOURLY

- "mongo-to-sql": script that reads BSON data from MongoDB and preprocess it, convert to tabular and saves in MySQL. Also saves a table with matchup information.

- "data-models": scripts that generate data models (aggregations of the raw sql tabels, for faster analyses).

# WEEKLY

- "generate-report": weekly script that generates the charts and tables used in the weekly report from the ranked data in MySQL. Also publish the script that generates the actual .md file to be used as report, saves it to lor-meta.com..
